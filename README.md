# My Tableau Extensions 

This is repository is a Python Flask project which leverages the [Tableau Extensions API](https://tableau.github.io/extensions-api/).

The project contains the two of the sample extensions delivered by Tableau (DataSources and Filtering).

The third extension is an extension of my own creation and it is an Amazon Product Search.
